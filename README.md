# Table Recognition Service

## Overview

The Table Recognition Service is a high-performance system built on the Swiss AI Center Core Engine,
designed for table recognition of image-based documents. It takes an image-based document and the results of a prior 
Layout Analysis service as input and provides:

    A ZIP file containing:
        The CSV files of the tables detected.


This service is inspired by state-of-the-art research and optimized for real-time performance on mobile and CPU devices,
leveraging PaddlePaddle's innovative detection architecture.
